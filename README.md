# angular-demo-crud
This project shows how to Filter, Insert, Update and Delete in a Simple way by using Angular 12+ and Material design to provide a good look and feel.

You can use this project as a Template to start your project and interact with MongoDb, Oracle, Sql Server ir any back-end.

For this project I am connecting with a .net core project to handle all the endpoints to save in MySql Database.
